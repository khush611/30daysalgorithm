# Time complexity:
## Note that the time complexity of the above Dynamic Programming (DP) solution is O(n^2) and there is a O(nLogn) solution for the LIS problem(but we have not covered that).

# Space Complexity: O(n)

## It has an optimal substructure and also exhibit overlapping subproblems and hence can be solved by dynamic approach.
