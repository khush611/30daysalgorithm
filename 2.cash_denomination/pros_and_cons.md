# METHOD:

## We are using very basic method to solve the Denomination of an Amount : Using While Loop.

**Real issue** : *In India as we have seen so far, to remove corruption the amount on the cash notes keep changing.*
 *For eg, Earlier we never had Rs. 200 note, but now we have.*
 *So in that case, little amendments have to be done in the code each time such changes are made.*
 *Other thing is,we should be knowing the amount of money for which cash is available.*

## pros:
1. it is very useful to fight counterfeit currency.

2. it combats tax evasion.

3. it discourages cash system. and make people to use another ways like digital payment options.

4. it helps disclose black money generated from parallel economy.

## cons:
1. India is progressively moving to cash less economy. So, introducing higher denominations of currency would be taking a step back in this objective because higher denomination leads to more black money and inflation. It is easier to store and transfer higher value notes as compared to lower ones.
